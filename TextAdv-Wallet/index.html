                    You are walking down a street all by your lonesome.<br />
                    It occurs to you that you've forgotten where you were going in the first place.
                    As you stand there, you notice a wallet before your feet.
                    The streets appear earily silent as you scan your surrounding for the owner of the wallet or police officers.

                    ..."Pick it up already!", the thought echoes in your mind over and over again,

                    As the light fades, you wonder to youself what you just experienced. You finally begin to snap out of it and get a sense of your surroundings.
                    No longer standing on a city sidewalk, you find yourself in a completely unrecognizable environment. <br />
